# SubParser

Simple code for generating a BASE64 encoded subscription file from a DIY YAML config.

It feels much convenience by using this little tool instead of manually copying multiple line 
into online BASE64 encoder tool to get the encoded code then manually pasting into a file on your server. ;)

Usage: In command line, just run \"python3 SubParser.py <config_file_name>\", then it will work instantly.
